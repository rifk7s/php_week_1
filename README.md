A small collection of PHP exercises and example files used for learning basic PHP concepts.

## About

This repository contains simple, self-contained PHP examples covering core language features — variables, control flow, functions, file I/O, arrays, OOP basics, and small web examples. It's intended for students following a web development course and for anyone practicing beginner PHP tasks.

## Contents

- `number1/` — many short example scripts grouped by topic (Variables, Strings, Arrays, Functions, OOP, etc.). These are exercise files from the course labeled as "number 1" in the original assignment.
- `exercise/` — tiny web examples like `index.php`, `modul1.php`, and `tabel.php`.
- `number2.php` — a standalone example file (from the separate "number 2" exercise in the assignment).

The folder and file names follow the exercise numbering used in the course (hence the names `number1` and `number2`).

## Quick start

Requirements:

- PHP 7.4+ (installed locally or available via XAMPP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For web examples: place this repository inside your web server document root (for XAMPP this is usually `C:/xampp/htdocs/`) and start Apache from the XAMPP control panel.

Run locally with XAMPP (Windows):

1. Start Apache from the XAMPP control panel.
2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost/tugas_webdev2_php/exercise/` to browse the web examples.

Run a single PHP file from the command line:

```bash
php number2.php
```
